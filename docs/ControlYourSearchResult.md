### Use cases

#### Control your search result using function_score (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.6/query-dsl-function-score-query.html).

Suppose we have an index called people where we have various information of people, for example age, name, etc.

1. Let's assume peoples' age range is between 1 and 120. Show the result in the following order

        - Age between 25 and 40 and who live in Austin (both conditions match)
        - Age not in between 25 and 40 but who live in Austin (city matches but not age)
        - Age between 25 and 40 but who do not live in Austin (age matches but not city)
        - Age not in between 25 and 40 and who do not live in Austin (neither matches)

         $curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/people/info/_search' -d '
         {
             "query": {
