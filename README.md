# Learn Elasticsearch From Example
====================================

We all love elasticsearch. Don't we? Elasticsearch (https://www.elastic.co/) is growing like crazy but unfortunately the documentation lacks concrete examples and hard for people to quickly write queries.
As a Elasticsearch lover, my goal is to build a living documentation with lots of examples for writing queries, performance tuning, elasticsearch code detail and NLP (Natural Language Processing) over the time.
