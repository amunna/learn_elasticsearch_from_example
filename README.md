# Learn Elasticsearch From Example
====================================

We all love elasticsearch. Don't we? Elasticsearch (https://www.elastic.co/) is growing like crazy but unfortunately the documentation lacks concrete examples and little harder for people to formulate a query quickly.
Example based learning has been proved effective in "Educational Research" and my goal is to build a document with lots of simple simple examples for writing queries. I would like to also cover performance tuning, Elasticsearch code detail and NLP (Natural Language Processing) over the time.

I am willing to offer any help/suggestion for free. Contact me at ahaduzzaman.munna@gmail.com.
